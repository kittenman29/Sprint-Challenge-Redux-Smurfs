1. Actions initialize the changes that we want to make to our state data.  They often are in charge of dispatching get, post, delete, and put calls via the axios library to initialize the data for the store state. Reducers take in actions via switch-case methods and return action-creators which are connected to the components via mapStateToProps.  Store holds all of our data coming from the API.  It is known as the 'single source of truth' because the state in the store is immutable and that state can be passed to any other component in the tree via connect/mstp.

2. Application state is referring to the data on state when you make your api get request.  It is immutable and doesn't change, but can be updated/re-rendered via mapping over. Component state is some anxillary state that is only used for UI and doesn't communicate with the state data being initialized by the dispatch axios requests.

3. Redux-thunk is middleware that, for lack of being able to describe it any better, does this; "when an action creator is called, redux-thunk will intercept and look at what is returned. If the thing returned is an action, it will forward the action through to the reducer. But, if the thing returned is a function, aka a thunk (a function returned from a function), then it will invoke that function and pass in the dispatch function as an argument to it."
